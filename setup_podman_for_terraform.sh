# Script: setup_podman_for_terraform.sh
# Description: This script automates the setup and configuration of Podman
#              to be used as a Docker-compatible environment for Terraform.
#              It installs Podman (if necessary), initializes and starts the
#              Podman virtual machine, and sets the DOCKER_HOST environment
#              variable to enable Terraform's Docker provider to connect to Podman.
# Usage: ./setup_podman_for_terraform.sh
# Dependencies: Homebrew (macOS), Podman, Terraform (for usage context)
#
