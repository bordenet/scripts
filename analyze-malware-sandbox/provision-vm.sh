# Script Name: provision-vm.sh
#
# Description: This script helps automate the final provisioning steps for the
#              inspection sandbox VM after Alpine Linux has been installed.
#              It starts a local HTTP server to facilitate transferring the
#              SSH public key to the VM, then provides manual instructions
#              for the user to execute within the VM console.
#
# Usage: ./provision-vm.sh
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - The VM has been created using 'create-vm.sh'.
#   - Alpine Linux has been installed inside the VM via 'setup-alpine'.
#   - The VM is running with a "Shared Network" connection.
#
# Dependencies: utmctl, python3
