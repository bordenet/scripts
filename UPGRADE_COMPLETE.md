- Verified all 81 scripts pass quality gates
- Created quality strategy document (UPGRADE_QUALITY_STRATEGY.md)
- Created analysis document (UPGRADE_ANALYSIS.md)

### 2. Validation ✅

Ran `./ci-quality-gates.sh` on all scripts:

```

Oversized Scripts (>400):   0

✅ All quality gates passed!
```

### 3. Documentation Updates ✅

Updated version references in:
- ✅ ASSESSMENT_REPORT.md (v1.2 → v2.0)
- ✅ COMPLIANCE_AUDIT.md (v1.2 → v2.0)
- ✅ Created UPGRADE_ANALYSIS.md
- ✅ Created UPGRADE_QUALITY_STRATEGY.md

## Requirements Comparison

### Core Requirements (UNCHANGED)

Both v1.2 and v2.0 require:

- ✅ Zero shellcheck warnings
- ✅ -h/--help flag (man-page style)
- ✅ -v/--verbose flag
- ✅ #!/usr/bin/env bash shebang
- ✅ set -euo pipefail error handling
- ✅ Wall clock timer (scripts >10s or deferred actions)
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization
- ✅ Platform detection (is_macos/is_linux)
- ✅ Error handling with trap cleanup
- ✅ --what-if flag for destructive operations

### What Changed in v2.0

**Format only:**

- Removed redundant examples

**Requirements:** NONE

## Quality Strategy Applied

Following the user's directive to "devise a quality strategy," we:

1. **Analyzed BEFORE acting** - Compared v1.2 vs v2.0 requirements
2. **Validated current state** - Ran quality gates on all scripts
3. **Discovered no changes needed** - Requirements are identical
4. **Updated documentation only** - Zero risk approach

**This prevented:** Breaking scripts by making unnecessary changes.

---

## Lessons Learned

The user's concern about "leaving scripts broken for weeks" was valid. This time we:

- ✅ Measured twice, cut once
- ✅ Analyzed requirements BEFORE touching code
- ✅ Verified compliance BEFORE making changes
- ✅ Discovered no changes needed
- ✅ Updated documentation only

**Result:** ZERO risk of breaking scripts.
