# FILENAME: scrub-git-history.sh
#
# DESCRIPTION:
# This script uses 'git-filter-repo' to rewrite the Git repository history,
# permanently removing specified files or directories from all commits. It uses
# the '--invert-paths' and '--paths-from-file' options, which means it will
# *keep* all files *except* those listed as paths to be scrubbed.
#
# It is primarily designed to remove sensitive data or large artifacts that were
# accidentally committed to the repository history.
#
# IMPORTANT:
# - This operation **rewrites history**, which is destructive. DO NOT run this on
#   a shared repository without coordinating with your team. All collaborators
#   will need to rebase or re-clone after the rewrite.
# - Requires 'git-filter-repo' (install with: pip install git-filter-repo).
# - Always creates a backup branch and tag before proceeding with the rewrite.
#
# USAGE:
# $0 [--file <path-to-file.txt>] [--preview] [path1 path2 ...]
#
# OPTIONS:
# --file <file> : Path to a .txt file with one path/glob per line to be scrubbed.
# --preview     : Show a list of commits that touch the specified paths without
#                 actually rewriting the history.
# [path1 ...]   : Positional arguments for paths/globs to be scrubbed.
#
# EXIT CODES:
# 1: Usage error (missing arguments, invalid option).
# 2: 'git-filter-repo' not found.
# 3: Not inside a Git repository.
# 4: Input file not found.
# 5: Failed to create backup branch or branch already exists.
# 6: Aborted by user confirmation.
