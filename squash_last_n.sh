# squash_last_n.sh
#
# Squashes the last <N> commits into a single new commit using git reset --soft.
# This method is non-interactive and avoids merge conflicts by taking the
# final state of the code from the newest commit in the range.
#
# Usage:
#   ./squash_last_n.sh <N> ["commit message"]
#
# Arguments:
#   <N>              - The number of recent commits to squash.
#   ["commit message"] - Optional. The message for the new squashed commit.
#                      Defaults to "Squash of last <N> commits".
#
# Example:
#   # Squash the last 5 commits into one
#   ./squash_last_n.sh 5 "Feat: Implement the new login flow"
#
