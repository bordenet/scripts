UTM doesn't support full CLI automation. Follow these steps:

1. Open UTM app
2. Click "+" (Create a New Virtual Machine)
3. Select "Emulate" (NOT Virtualize - boot compatibility)
4. Select "Other"
5. Skip ISO for now (we'll add it in settings)
6. Use these settings:

   **Architecture:** x86_64
   **RAM:** 2048 MB
   **CPU Cores:** 2

7. **Storage:**
   - Size: 8 GB
   - Leave other settings as default

8. **Shared Directory:**
   - Browse and select the "shared" directory in this folder
   - Set to "Read Only"

9. **Summary:**
   - Name: inspection-sandbox
   - Click "Save"

10. AFTER creating the VM, click the VM name, then click the üéõÔ∏è (Edit) icon:

    **Add the Alpine ISO:**
    - Look for "Drives" section in the left sidebar
    - Click "New..." or "+"
    - Select "Removable" or "CD/DVD"
    - Browse and select: alpine.iso (in this directory)

    **Network Tab:**
    - Network Mode: "Shared Network" (we'll isolate it AFTER installation)
    - Do NOT check "Isolate Guest from Host" yet

    **Port Forwarding (under Network):**
    - Click "New..."
    - Protocol: TCP
    - Guest Port: 22
    - Host Address: 127.0.0.1
    - Host Port: 2222

    **Sharing Tab:**
    - Directory Share Mode: VirtFS (won't work with standard Alpine, but set it anyway)
    - ‚ùå Uncheck "Enable Clipboard Sharing"

11. Save the settings

12. Start the VM and follow the installation instructions in:
    ./ACTUAL-WORKING-SETUP.md

    Key steps:
    - Login as root (no password)
    - Run: setup-alpine
    - Follow prompts
    - After install, use HTTP server method to transfer SSH key
