# Troubleshooting Guide

## VM Boots to UEFI Shell Instead of Alpine Installer

**Symptom:** VM starts and shows `UEFI Interactive Shell v2.2` with `Shell> _` prompt

**Cause:** The boot order is incorrect - VM is not booting from the ISO

**Solution:**

### Option 1: Boot from ISO manually (Quick Fix)

In the UEFI Shell, type:
```
fs0:
```
Then:
```
ls
```
You should see EFI files. Then run:
```
\EFI\BOOT\BOOTX64.EFI
```

This will boot the Alpine installer.

### Option 2: Boot Using UEFI Setup Menu

1. **Restart the VM**
2. Immediately press **ESC** repeatedly during boot
3. You should enter the UEFI setup menu
4. Look for "Boot Manager" or "Boot Options"
5. Select the CD-ROM/ISO drive to boot from
6. This will boot the Alpine installer

### Option 3: Fix in UTM Settings (For Future Boots)

Unfortunately, UTM's Virtualize mode doesn't allow manual boot order configuration in the UI like Emulate mode does. The workaround is to use the UEFI shell method (Option 1) or boot menu (Option 2) each time, OR remove the ISO after installation (see below).

### After Installing Alpine (Remove the ISO)

Once you've installed Alpine Linux to the hard disk:

1. **Shut down the VM completely** (`poweroff` inside the VM)
2. In UTM, click the VM name, then click üéõÔ∏è (Edit)
3. In the left sidebar, look for your drives under a section (not a "Drives" tab)
4. Click on the **CD/DVD drive** (the one with alpine.iso)
5. Look for options like:
   - "Remove" button, OR
   - "Clear" button, OR
   - Change "Image Type" to "None"
6. This removes the ISO from the VM
7. Click **"Save"**
8. Restart the VM

Now it will boot directly from the installed Alpine system on the hard disk.

**Alternative:** If you can't find how to remove the ISO, just use Option 1 (the UEFI shell commands) each time you boot until Alpine is fully installed. After running the Alpine installer and choosing `poweroff`, subsequent boots should automatically go to the hard disk.

## Other Common Issues

### SSH Connection Timeout

**Solution:**
```bash
# Inside the VM, check if SSH is running
service sshd status

# If not running, start it
service sshd start

# Make sure it starts on boot
rc-update add sshd
```

### Shared Directory Not Mounting

**Solution:**
```bash
# Inside the VM
mkdir -p /media/shared
mount -t 9p -o trans=virtio,version=9p2000.L shared /media/shared

# Add to /etc/fstab for auto-mount
echo "shared /media/shared 9p trans=virtio,version=9p2000.L,ro,_netdev 0 0" >> /etc/fstab
```

### VM is Very Slow

**Check:** Are you using **Virtualize** mode or Emulate mode?
- ‚úÖ Virtualize = Fast
- ‚ùå Emulate = Very slow

**Solution:** Recreate the VM using Virtualize mode (see create-vm.sh)

### Can't Connect - Port 2222 Not Open

**Check port forwarding in UTM:**
1. Edit VM ‚Üí Network tab ‚Üí Port Forwarding
2. Verify:
   - Protocol: TCP
   - Guest Port: 22
   - Host Address: 127.0.0.1
   - Host Port: 2222

### Alpine Installation Asks for Password But I Don't Have One

During `setup-alpine`, when it asks for the root password, you're **setting** it (not entering an existing one). Choose a strong password - you'll need it to login.

After SSH is configured with keys, you won't need the password anymore (key-based auth).
